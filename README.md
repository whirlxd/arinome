unprocess
===========================

This project is based on https://github.com/android/camera-samples/tree/main/Camera2Basic and is a
simple, open source solution to taking unprocessed images on your Android phone, free of
modern devices' excessive computational photography.

Introduction
------------

unprocess uses the [Camera2 API][1] to capture raw sensor data from the camera before being
converted to a human-viewable file format.

Currently, unprocess allows users to choose between RAW (.dng) or JPEG (.jpg) for the final,
saved file. The images are captured in the same way, but in the latter case the raw data is
converted from RAW to bitmap data before being compressed into a JPEG.
